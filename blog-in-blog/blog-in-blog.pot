If you want to have more than one template in use for different instances of the shortcode, you can specify a template file using a shortcode paramater. We always look in `wp-content/uploads/` for your template file first (your template will be safe under uploads/) before looking in `wp-content/plugins/blog-in-blog` (your template will probably be lost when the plugin is upgraded). For more template tags see the help tab."
